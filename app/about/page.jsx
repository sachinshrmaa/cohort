      <p className="my-3">
        The Basics Class or TBC is an initiative by Sachin Sharma to personally
        teach students in the field of Software Engineering.
      </p>
      <p className="my-3">
        Sachin strongly believes that programming skills should be taught in a
        live manner and by building real-world projects rather than just
        understanding the syntax and the concepts.
      </p>
      <p className="my-3">
        All the courses and workshops are a series of live cohorts, focusing
        more on building projects and Open source contributions and you get to
        interact with the instructor whenever you get stuck.
