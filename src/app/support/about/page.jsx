            <p>Hi there! My name is Sachin, I'm a computer engineering student majoring in artificial intelligence and machine learning at <a href="http://www.sist.edu.in/Public/Index/Home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Sikkim Institute of Science and Technology</a>, Chisopani, Sikkim - India.</p>
            <p>Apart from studies I like to <a href="https://stipill.in" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">build software</a> related to the web and ml. I like to spend my leisure time reading books(mostly non-fiction), teaching data science at <a href="/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">the basics class</a>, and writing about finance, health, tech, and more at <a href="https://sachinsblog.in" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SachinsBlog</a>.</p>
            <p>And once a week I set aside some time to share the things I'm learning through my work, books, and awesome people I meet through my <a href="https://sachinsblog.in/newsletter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">SachinsBlog Insider Newsletter</a>(feel free to join).</p>
